ABC
============
The Automata Based Counter ([ABC](https://vlab.cs.ucsb.edu/ABC/)) is a **string and numeric constriant** solver and
**model counter**. ABC provides solutions to systems of string and numeric constraints in the form of a deterministic
finite automaton. In addition ABC produces symbolic representation of the number of strings and integers within a length
bound, k, that satisfy a set of constraints. ABC can also output the number of satisfying solutions given a bound.

Setup
============
ABC is a C++ executable and a C++ shared library with JNI interfaces. You can 
use it as a static or dynamic lib or you can run it from command line.

###Download
  
```
$ cd <your home directory or a preferred directory>
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:vlab-cs-ucsb/ABC.git ABC # or use https://github.com/vlab-cs-ucsb/ABC.git
```
ABC testing depends on [googletest and googlemock](https://github.com/google/googletest) as subprojects. It is important to clone with ``--recursive`` option.

###Easy(Automated) Setup
  - [ABC](https://vlab.cs.ucsb.edu/ABC/). Clone ABC source and run build script. It automatically tries to install required system packages and dependent projects; [Glog](https://github.com/google/glog) and [Mona](http://www.brics.dk/mona/). After installing dependencies, it installs ABC. If script does not work please try step-by-step guide or contact us. (That script is tested with Linux machines. You can still use build script in other posix systems if you resolve system dependencies manually.)
  
  ```
  $ cd ABC/build
  $ ./install-build-deps.py
  ```

###Step-by-Step(Semi-automated) Setup
####System Dependencies
  - C++ compiler with C++14 support. Latest ABC compilation is tested with g++ 5.4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

  ```
    $ sudo apt install git
  ```
  - ABC is an autotools project, you need to setup autotools in your system. Please make sure you have installed all the tools below.

  ```
    $ sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool intltool
  ```
  - Lex and Yacc. ABC is tested with [Flex 2.6.0](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/flex.html) and [Bison 3.0.4](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/).

  ```
    $ sudo apt install flex bison
  ```

  - Python (optional). A short installation script is written in pyhton.
    
  ```
    $ sudo apt install python
  ```

####Project Dependencies
  - [Glog](https://github.com/google/glog) logging library for C++. It is an autotools project. 
  Please follow the instructions in their website if the below shortcut doesn't work for you. Don't forget to apply patch 
  as below:

  ```
  $ cd <your home directory or a preferred directory>
  $ git clone https://github.com/google/glog.git
  $ cd glog
  $ git apply <ABC_ROOT_DIR>/external/glog/glog_abc_autotools.patch
  $ libtoolize && aclocal && automake --gnu --add-missing && autoreconf -ivf
  $ ./configure
  $ make all
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo ldconfig
  
  ```
  You should have glog libraries installed at */usr/local/lib* and headers installed at */usr/local/include/glog/* after running above commands. 

  - [Mona](http://www.brics.dk/mona/) is used for symbolic representation of automata. Don't forget to apply patch as below: 

  ```sh
    $ cd <your home directory or a preferred directory>
    $ git clone https://github.com/cs-au-dk/MONA.git
    $ cd MONA
    $ git apply <ABC_ROOT_DIR>/external/mona/mona_abc.patch
    $ libtoolize && aclocal && automake --gnu --add-missing && autoreconf -ivf
    $ ./configure
    $ make all
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig

  ``` 
  You should have mona libraries installed at */usr/local/lib* and headers installed at */usr/local/include/mona/* after running above commands. 


####ABC Installation

  - [ABC](https://vlab.cs.ucsb.edu/ABC/).

  ```
    $ cd <your home directory or a preferred directory>
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:vlab-cs-ucsb/ABC.git ABC // or use https://github.com/vlab-cs-ucsb/ABC.git
    $ cd ABC
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make all
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
  ```

  If you want to use *ABC* with *JAVA* programs, make sure **JAVA_HOME** environment variable is set and has a valid Java installation path before running *./configure* command. 


  At this point you should have all necessary libraries installed at *__/usr/local/lib__* directory. You should also have all necessary header files at  
  *__/usr/local/include/glog__*,  
  *__/usr/local/include/mona__*,  
  *__/usr/local/include/abc__*  
  directories.

Usage
============

####C++
    You can link to dynamic library generated in your program. An example executable for mtabc is generated for you and install in your system. You can run mtabc executable at your home directory as:
  
  $ abc -i  <input_file_path>
  $ abc --help #lists available command line options

  E.g.,

  $ abc -i <abc source folder>/test/fixtures/solver/ConstraintSolver/test_visitBegins_01.smt2

  For an example of model counting a string with bound <= 5:

  $ abc -i <abc source folder>/test/fixtures/solver/ConstraintSolver/test_visitBegins_01.smt2 -v 0 -bs 5

  where -v 0 disables debugging output, and -bs 5 means count solutions with bound <= 5

  If there are more than one string variables, you can specify which one you want to model count with the argument: --count-variable <VARIABLE_NAME>
  
  You can take a look at *__&lt;abc source folder&gt;/src/main.cpp__* to see how *__abc__* is used in a C++ program as a shared library. 
  
  (More documentation on ABC input language and format will be provided, please see *__&lt;abc-source-folder&gt;/test/fixtures__* folder for examples)
  
####JAVA

  You have to compile *__ABC__* with your *__JAVA_HOME__* path is set to a valid java path. Once you set your *__JAVA_HOME__* path, you need to install/re-install *__ABC__* on your system. 
  
  You need to set Java VM argument __java.library.path__ to path where your shared libraries are install, or alternatively you can set __LD_LIBRARY_PATH__ environment variable to that path.

  You can use *__&lt;abc-source-folder&gt;/lib/ABCJava__* as an example Java program that calls __abc__.

  In your Java project all you have to do is to include the contents of *__&lt;abc-source-folder&gt;/lib/ABCJava/src/__*. *vlab.cs.ucsb.edu.DriverProxy.java* class is the class that makes abc calls.

####Workflow

  1- Always start working on your own branch, do not directly work on master branch

  2- Follow [rebase work flow whenever](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) possible

  3- If you are not sure how to merge/rebase with/onto master, create a fresh branch out of master and first try to merge/rebase using that branch.

####Coding Style

  Please follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
